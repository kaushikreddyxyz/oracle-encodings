"""Tokenizer bridge for cross-tokenizer alignment (Stage 7-Oracle Phase 2).

See ../DESIGN.md ("align.py API", frozen) and ../SPEC.md (Phase 2,
"Tokenizer bridge Gemma->Qwen") for the design rationale.

Pure python/numpy. Tokenizer-agnostic: the alignment functions operate on
char-offset maps (lists of ``(start, end)`` int pairs, as returned by HF fast
tokenizers with ``return_offsets_mapping=True``), NOT on tokenizer objects.
This lets the same module bridge gemma->qwen today and qwen->nanochat later
-- only the offset maps change, not the code.

Terminology below follows the frozen naming in DESIGN.md: "gemma" = source
tokenizer/tokenization, "qwen" = target tokenizer/tokenization. Nothing in
the implementation actually depends on gemma or qwen specifically.

Modes
-----
``mode="prefix"`` (primary): for each source token, find the LAST target
token whose char span ends at or before the source token's end char (a
causal prefix-state lookup -- no future leakage). O(Tg + Tq) via a
two-pointer scan, since both offset sequences are char-monotonic
(non-decreasing end-char position) for any left-to-right tokenization.

``mode="boundary"`` (fallback, used when the prefix-mode crossing rate is
too high): re-tokenize each source token's substring independently with the
target tokenizer, forcing exact boundary alignment at the cost of losing
target-tokenizer context across the substring boundary. See
``gemma_to_qwen_map(..., mode="boundary")`` docstring for the calling
convention (it takes an extra ``retokenize`` callable, since re-tokenizing
requires an actual tokenizer -- this is the one place this module touches a
real tokenizer, always via a caller-supplied callable, never by importing
a tokenizer library itself).

Empty-span / special tokens: HF fast tokenizers report special tokens
(e.g. BOS/EOS) with an empty span, canonically ``(0, 0)`` but in general
any ``start == end``. This module treats ANY offset with ``start == end``
as an empty-span/special token:
  - on the SOURCE side: it is skipped (mapped to ``-1`` unconditionally,
    regardless of its position in the sequence).
  - on the TARGET side: it is excluded from consideration as an alignment
    anchor (it can never be "the last qwen token whose span ends <= ...").

    Uses ``return_offsets_mapping=True`` on a fast tokenizer. Modern HF fast
    tokenizers (tokenizers >= 0.19-ish, transformers >= 4.x) already report
    proper char offsets into the original string for both byte-level BPE
    (GPT-2/Qwen family) and SentencePiece-based (Gemma/Llama family)
    tokenizers -- the historical "byte-level offset" quirk (offsets that
    index into a byte-remapped intermediate string, e.g. off-by-N around
    multibyte UTF-8 sequences, or endpoints that don't reconstruct the
    original substring) mostly affected older/slow tokenizers. This

    never see offsets that violate the invariants downstream code depends
    on: ``0 <= start <= end <= len(text)`` and, for non-empty spans,
